# Airline Data Analysis with Pig

+ This exercise is inspired by http://www.datadr.org/doc/airline.html [Broken Link]
+ Full information on datasets (optional datasets), and general documentation available here: http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/

Before we start, here's a description of the dataset "schema". We will work on data that can be downloaded from here: http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

Note that there is a single CSV file per year, hence the first field below is somehow redundant, although you can imagine to concatenate all files and work on them as a whole (which by the way would make sense when using Hadoop MapReduce / Pig). In summary, there are 29 fields which provide enough information to build Pig scripts that cover Queries 1-5. For the advanced analysis subsection, you need other data, which can be downloaded from the links below.

```
1	 Year	1987-2008
2	 Month	1-12
3	 DayofMonth	1-31
4	 DayOfWeek	1 (Monday) - 7 (Sunday)
5	 DepTime	actual departure time (local, hhmm)
6	 CRSDepTime	scheduled departure time (local, hhmm)
7	 ArrTime	actual arrival time (local, hhmm)
8	 CRSArrTime	scheduled arrival time (local, hhmm)
9	 UniqueCarrier	unique carrier code
10	 FlightNum	flight number
11	 TailNum	plane tail number
12	 ActualElapsedTime	in minutes
13	 CRSElapsedTime	in minutes
14	 AirTime	in minutes
15	 ArrDelay	arrival delay, in minutes
16	 DepDelay	departure delay, in minutes
17	 Origin	origin IATA airport code
18	 Dest	destination IATA airport code
19	 Distance	in miles
20	 TaxiIn	taxi in time, in minutes
21	 TaxiOut	taxi out time in minutes
22	 Cancelled	was the flight cancelled?
23	 CancellationCode	reason for cancellation (A = carrier, B = weather, C = NAS, D = security)
24	 Diverted	1 = yes, 0 = no
25	 CarrierDelay	in minutes
26	 WeatherDelay	in minutes
27	 NASDelay	in minutes
28	 SecurityDelay	in minutes
29	 LateAircraftDelay	in minutes
```

Other sources of data come from here: http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/supplemental-data.html. Precisely, we are interested in:

+ Airport IATA Codes to City names and Coordinates mapping: http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/airports.csv
+ Carrier codes to Full name mapping: http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/carriers.csv
+ Information about individual planes: http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/plane-data.csv
+ Weather information: http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/. You can subscribe for free to the developers API and obtain (at a limited rate) hystorical weather information in many different formats. Also, to get an idea of the kind of information is available, you can use this link: http://www.wunderground.com/history/

## The Data:
For Eurecom students, we have put some csv (comma separate values) files in HDFS for you. They are located in the HDFS directory: ```/laboratory/airlines/``` and they account for four years of data, 2005 to 2008. You can work on individual years, or feed the entire directory to your jobs such that you can process all years.

## Exercises:
In the following, we propose a series of exercises in the form of Queries.

### *Query 1:* Top 20 airports by total volume of flights 

What are the busiest airports by total flight traffic. JFK will feature, but what are the others? For each airport code compute the number of inbound, outbound and all flights. Variation on the theme: compute the above by day, week, month, and over the years.

### *Query 2:* Carrier Popularity 

Some carriers come and go, others demonstrate regular growth. Compute the (log base 10) volume -- total flights -- over each year, by carrier. The carriers are ranked by their median volume (over the 4 year span).

### *Query 3:* Proportion of Flights Delayed 

A flight is delayed if the delay is greater than 15 minutes. Compute the fraction of delayed flights per different time granularities (hour, day, week, month, year).

### *Query 4:* Carrier Delays

Is there a difference in carrier delays? Compute the proportion of delayed flights by carrier, ranked by carrier, at different time granularities (hour, day, week, month year). Again, a flight is delayed if the delay is greater than 15 minutes.

### *Query 5:* Busy Routes

Which routes are the busiest? A simple first approach is to create a frequency table for the unordered pair (i,j) where i and j are distinct airport codes.

## Optional data analysis tasks
Note that the following "queries" are somehow more involved than the preceding ones. They require a more elaborated approach and in some cases they require additional data to be downloaded (see sources above) and copied into HDFS.

+ When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimize delays?
+ Do older planes suffer more delays?
+ How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
+ How well does weather predict plane delays?
+ Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? Are there critical links in the system?
